Miter 2022: ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix
 
- Reconnaissance an act of collecting information that can be used for planning a future attack.
  
- Searching for victim-owned websites is a technique used by an attacker to search websites  owned by a victim for details such as name, contact information, location or others.
  
- Resource development is used to create, buy or steal resources used for the attack.

- Obtain Infrastructure is a technique used to buy, lease or rent infrastructure to host domains, DNS servers, virtual private servers, botnets or others.

- Initial Access is an attempt to gain access to a victim's network 

- Phishing is a technique used to trick the victim into executing malicious attachments or opening links in phishing messages in order to gain access to the victim's system. 

- Execution executes malicious code on local or remote systems.

- User execution is a technique  that relies on the victim to perform actions such as clicking on a link or file using social engineering to run malicious code on their system. 

- Persistence is when the attacker is attempting to maintain access to the victim's system during reboots, different user accounts, or other interruptions.

- Boot or login initialization scripts are a technique in which the attacker uses scripts that run automatically when they start or log in logs in to maintain access.

- Permission escalation is used to get elevated privileges within the network or system.

- Domain policy modification is a technique where the attacker modifies a domain's configuration settings to gain permissions in the domain environments.

- Defense evasion is a practice used to avoid detection.

- Registry modification is a technique used to hide configuration information within registry keys.

- Accessing credentials is used for stealing credentials like account names and passwords from victim.

- Password vault credentials is a technique where  attacker looks for common password storage locations like keychains, web browsers, password managers etc. passwords or others to collect user credentials.

- Detection is used in gaining knowledge about the target system or network environment.

- Browser bookmark detection is a technique used to search for  bookmarks to reveal personal information about the compromised user.

- Lateral Movement the act of maneuvering through the target system to reach the target.

- Software Deployment Tools are third-party software packages that are installed on a corporate network for management, monitoring, or other purposes and are used by attackers to  navigate through the system to move.
 
- Collection is used to collect data  of interest to the target.

- Clipboard data is data stored in the target system's clipboard, where the user copies information within or between applications. It is often collected to steal password details or general information about what the user is doing.

- Command and Control is the communication between the attacker and the target system to control its environment.

- Non-standard port is a technique used to communicate with the target system using a protocol/port pairing that is not normally used. An attacker can change the default port used by a protocol to avoid filtering or to confuse the analysis of network data.

- Exfiltration attempts to extract data steal from the target.

- C2 channel exfiltrationis a method used by an attacker to transmit data over an existing command and control channel connection with the target system. Data is encrypted over the normal communications channel using the same protocol as command and control communications.

- Impact is done to a business through operational manipulation, disruption of availability , or destruction of the target system or data.

- Account Access Removal is used to disrupt the availability of system and network resources by removing, blocking or tampering with user account credentials.

- Techniques describe how an attacker achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. 

      Example: attacker downloads credentials to gain access.

- Subtechniques describe in more detail how an opponent achieves a tactical objective. They may be grouped with other subtechniques such as technique.

- Tactics represent the why or the reason why performs an action of a technique or subtechnique.

      Example: The attacker wants to gain access with access data in order to advance his goal of penetrating a target system.

- Software means custom or commercial code, operating system utilities, open source software, or other tools used by groups to perform the activities described in ATT&CK.

- Groups are a collection of related attack activities known by one or more common names in the security community.

      Example: "Killnet" is a pro-Russian hacker group known for its DoS (denial of service) and DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks towards government institutions and private companies in several countries during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The group is thought to have been formed sometime around March 2022.

OWASP - Cross Site Scripting (XSS):
A type of injection attack used to send malicious code in the form of a script is taken by user input from a website or application to the target server.

- If the website does not validate or encrypt user input, the attacker can run the script without being caught as the script appears to come from a trusted source.

- The script may provide access to cookies, session tokens, or other confidential information
that stores a browser session.

- Stored XSS (persistent or Type I XSS) are attacks where the injected script is persistently stored on target servers.

- Reflected XSS (non-persistent XSS or Type II) are attacks where the injected script is mirrored or redirected to the attacker outside of the web server in the form of an error message, resulting in searches or perform other responses displayed in the web application.

y) Short story

Cross Site Scripting

A user named Kappa123 livestreams on a brand new platform called "Twatch". It's ran by a decentralized group of volunteers who have almost no experience in network security. One day, a user named SeemsGood321 posts a big chunk of gibberish which turned out to be an XSS attack script in Kappa123's chat, which is connected through a P2P network with little to no sanitization what so ever. After the message is received, the malicious piece of code is executed and Kappa123 loses access to his account after a few minutes. All that was possible by exploiting session cookies which the website provided to SeemsGood321.

a & b) Webgoat

A3 Sensitive data exposure

no. 2 - Insecure login

  this task can be completed by using the built-in devtools accessed by hitting f12, from which we go to network tab and monitor what happens after we press the "login" button, which then sends a "POST" request of other users credentials, which we then find in the same tab.

A7 Cross Site Scripting

no. 2 - What is XSS

session cookie can be exposed with this simple trick using the devtools mentioned below, this time we'll be using the console:

    javascript:alert(document.cookie);

as stated in the exercise, the output is the same in each tab.

no.7 - Reflecting XSS

vulnerable fields are found using:

    <script> console.log("Hello") </script>
once the script is executed when clicking "Purchase", the vulnerable field is found which allows us to continue with the reflected XSS attack.
